name: elaboration
description: Write a high-signal-to-noise mathematical progress synthesis of a project from the shared stores (global memory + fact graph), following a fixed verdict→routes→interfaces→dangers→bridges template and a strict honesty discipline. Use it each strategic cycle, right before the strategy consult — the elaboration is what you feed the consult; the consult's reply becomes master_guidance.

# Elaboration

You are the **main agent**. Each strategic cycle (whenever the workers finish a
round, or you otherwise have genuinely new state) you distill the project's
current state into one **elaboration**: a readable, deeply-analytical synthesis
for a strategist — high signal, no filler. It is the *input* you prepare for the
strategy consult (the `consult` skill); the consult's reply becomes the next
`master_guidance`. Instead of peer workers reviewing each other, you distill the
shared state and one high-intelligence model reasons over it.

The elaboration is also what you draw on to keep the operator informed.

## Template invariants (validate every elaboration against these)

A well-formed elaboration satisfies all of the following — a worker or linter can
check them mechanically:

- **Five sections, in order, no dropped heading:** §0 Mathematical verdict · §1
  Closed components and obsolete routes · §2 Interface contract table · §3
  Dangerous heuristic lines and strategies not to pursue · §4 Missing bridge
  lemmas. An empty section is written as its honest empty-state line, never
  omitted.
- **The two fixed empty-state lines** (§1) are used verbatim when a subsection is
  empty:
  - `_(no signed-closed components yet)_`
  - `_(no failed or obsolete routes recorded; absence here does not mean the strategy is unique)_`
- **Exactly seven status labels**, UPPERCASE, drawn only from: **CLOSED ·
  SUBSTANTIAL · PARTIAL · DANGEROUS · FALSE AS STATED · OBSOLETE · UNKNOWN**.
- **§0 opens** with exactly one bolded verdict line and contains the status
  dashboard table + the sub-task status summary table + the Current best proof
  skeleton + the Central missing lemma.
- **Every `fact_id` cited exists** in the fact graph; no invented ids, no
  paraphrase substituted for a verified statement.
- **Published** via `gm_add(kind="elaboration", …)` with `verifiable` left at its
  default (`false`).

## Input Contract

Read **only the shared stores** — never a worker's private local memory (a layer
boundary, and the reason this is cleaner than a log-scraping summary agent). All
reads are project-scoped for the main agent (`project=<p>`):

- **global memory** — findings, dead ends, recent `verification` traces, the
  current `master_guidance`. Read via `gm_search`, or as a fallback by reading the
  raw `runtime/projects/<p>/global_memory/<kind>.jsonl` files.
- **fact graph** — the verified facts, their statements, and the DAG. Read via
  `fact_search`, or as a fallback by reading the raw
  `runtime/projects/<p>/fact_graph/facts/*.md` files: what is established vs. still
  open, and how facts compose.
- **the project's problem statement** — the fixed goal and, if present, its
  enumerated sub-tasks / intended proof architecture.

## The fixed goal is sacred

Quote the goal and **do not change or weaken it** — do not redefine, simplify,
restrict to a special case, or substitute an easier proxy. If the evidence
suggests the goal may be false or unreachable by the current strategy, **say so
plainly while keeping the goal fixed.**

## Template — five sections

Produce one markdown document with these sections, in order. Omit a section's
body only by writing the honest empty-state line, never by dropping the heading.

### 0. Mathematical verdict

Open with **one** of these, in bold on its own line:

> **Not solved.** … | **Counterexample found.** … | **Verified complete proof.** … | **Solved.** …

Then:

- **Closed components** — what is signed-closed today (1–2 sentences; cite `fact_id`s).
- **Viable proof architecture** — one sentence naming the current best route.
- **Main blocker** — what concretely blocks right now (1–2 sentences; cite `fact_id`s).
- **Highest-priority unresolved bridge** — the most leveraged missing lemma / integration package.
- **Method failure vs. proposition failure** — state explicitly whether the evidence indicates a *method* has failed (the conjecture may still hold) or the *proposition itself* may be false. Use the phrase "method failure" or "proposition failure" verbatim.
- **Calibration caveat** — one line warning the reader against over-reading status labels (e.g. "Do not read SUBSTANTIAL/CONDITIONAL as 'almost solved' — every such row has an unmatched hypothesis on the actual model.").

Then a **status dashboard** (one table) with at least these rows: Fixed goal
(UNCHANGED, with goal text); Verified complete proof (YES/NO); Verified
counterexample (YES/NO); Signed-closed sub-tasks (count + names); Main blocker
(a specific lemma, not vague); Routes marked false/obsolete (YES/NO + which);
Highest-priority unresolved task (P0/P1/P2 with the exact mathematical task).

Then a **sub-task status summary** (one table: Sub-task | Status | Closed facts |
Conditional facts | Main missing interface), one row per sub-task the problem
enumerates. Use **only** these UPPERCASE labels:

- **CLOSED** — verified on the *actual* construction, no remaining
  hypothesis-matching. A theorem import or conditional package being available is
  **not** CLOSED — that is SUBSTANTIAL. CLOSED is rare; default away from it.
- **SUBSTANTIAL** — a conditional package exists, but ≥1 input/output hypothesis
  is unmatched on the actual construction. The *default* for a sub-task with
  load-bearing tools not yet applied to the actual model.
- **PARTIAL** — isolated ingredients only; no coherent conditional package yet.
- **DANGEROUS** — a plausible shortcut that is false / insufficient / hypothesis-sensitive.
- **FALSE AS STATED** — a once-plausible formulation now refuted; do not pursue as stated.
- **OBSOLETE** — superseded by a better route; do not pursue.
- **UNKNOWN** — insufficient verified information.

> **Strict CLOSED test.** For each sub-task you are tempted to mark CLOSED, ask:
> "Is there a verified fact that handles this on the *actual* construction, with
> zero remaining hypothesis to match?" If you cannot answer YES with a specific
> `fact_id` and zero remaining work, mark SUBSTANTIAL. Over-marking CLOSED is the
> single most damaging error here — it reads as "no further work needed."

End §0 with **Current best proof skeleton** (6–12 short numbered lines: the
smallest structure that closes the goal *if* the central missing lemma were
known, with `fact_id`s where facts apply) and **Central missing lemma** (the
single most precise unresolved statement, at full precision — all quantifiers,
definitions inlined for self-containment, and one short "why this is non-trivial"
paragraph if warranted).

### 1. Closed components and obsolete routes

- **Signed-closed components** — a bullet list ("<math content> — `fact_id`s
  `…`") or the line `_(no signed-closed components yet)_`.
- **Failed or obsolete routes** — a table (Route | FALSE AS STATED / OBSOLETE |
  one-line reason citing a `fact_id` / concrete obstruction), or
  `_(no failed or obsolete routes recorded; absence here does not mean the strategy is unique)_`.
  FALSE AS STATED = a plausible reduction now refuted; OBSOLETE = superseded by a
  simpler live route.

### 2. Interface contract table

The single most important diagnostic — a human reader uses it to find exactly
which input/output hypothesis is unmatched on the actual model. For **each**
interface in the proof architecture (use the exact sub-task names the problem
enumerates: per-stage A/B/C…, each transition B→C, C→D…, and the meta-reduction
to the original statement):

> ### \<Interface name\> — \<one-line role in the proof\>
> **Input required.** \<precise mathematical conditions step i+1 demands of step i's output — normality, Q-factoriality, R-Cartierness, dimension, …; not just "compatibility"\>
> **Output claimed.** \<what the existing conditional package guarantees, conditional on its own hypotheses\>
> **Available facts.** `fact_id` — one-line statement; …
> **Missing verification on the actual model.** \<numbered: the specific hypothesis-matches not yet carried out on the actual construction\>
> **Failure mode if ignored.** \<one or two sentences: what concretely breaks downstream — e.g. "If K_W+B_W is not Q-Cartier, 'by negativity lemma' is vacuous and the crepancy conclusion is unjustified."\>
> **Status.** \<one of the seven labels\>

Do not skip an interface even if its row is trivial — flag trivial matches so a
cold reader knows they were considered. Inline the definitions of load-bearing
terms so a cold reader need not consult the problem statement. If the problem is
built around a single central lemma rather than a pipeline, produce one interface
row for the central reduction in the same format. **Strict CLOSED rule applies
per row:** if "Missing verification" is non-empty, the status is SUBSTANTIAL or
weaker — never CLOSED.

### 3. Dangerous heuristic lines and strategies not to pursue

- **Dangerous heuristic lines** — 3–8 specific shortcut statements found
  **verbatim or in close paraphrase** in the problem's strategy outline or prior
  notes (preserve the wording so the reader can locate them). For each: a
  **Status** (one of: "Not automatic" / "Mathematically incorrect as stated" /
  "Conditional only" / "Method shortcut, not a proof step" / "Conflated with a
  stronger claim") and one 2–4 sentence paragraph on the precise reason it is
  unjustified, citing `fact_id`s; give the correct rephrasing where one is needed.
- **Strategies not to pursue** — 4–8 one-line anti-routes, each concrete: "Do not
  \<specific action\>: \<one-line reason\>." Vague entries ("avoid weakness") are
  forbidden.

### 4. Missing bridge lemmas

Identify 2–4 **bridge lemmas** — concrete intermediate facts that, if proven,
would either prove the central missing lemma or unblock a specific interface row.
For each:

> ### Bridge k — \<short name\>
> **Target statement.** \<full, precise mathematical statement\>
> **Prerequisites.** \<conditions the inputs must satisfy for the statement to type-check\>
> **Existing facts to use.** `fact_id` — one-line claim; … (only ids that actually exist)
> **Missing checks.** \<numbered: the specific hypothesis-matches / sub-proofs still needed\>
> **Closure criterion.** \<one paragraph naming the exact proof obligation that closes this bridge\>

Order by **leverage**: Bridge 1 unblocks the most downstream / has the highest
payoff per unit effort. State for each whether it is independent
(parallelizable) or dependent — this is what lets you put different workers on
different bridges.

## Discipline (hard rules)

- **Do not treat conjectural material as verified** — a claim without a `fact_id`
  is awareness, not truth.
- **No numerical distance estimates.** Never "≈ 8–12 facts", "2–4 focused runs",
  "80% done". Distance is qualitative. Estimating a numeric distance is forbidden.
- **No process telemetry.** No worker counts, service state, mtimes, run
  scheduling — this is purely mathematical. Do not discuss how the elaboration
  was produced, scheduled, or delivered.
- **No agent-facing directives.** The elaboration is a *synthesis*, not a
  dispatch order. Turning it into instructions for workers is the strategy
  consult's job (→ `master_guidance`), and dispatch is yours afterward — not part
  of this artifact.
- **Honest, not reassuring.** Surface hidden assumptions, possibly-false
  statements, and places where a status label may mislead. Do not round
  SUBSTANTIAL up to "almost done".

## Output Contract

Publish the elaboration to global memory with `gm_add`:

- `kind`: `elaboration`
- `claim`: the §0 verdict line (the bolded opener + the one-line main blocker)
- `evidence`: the full five-section markdown body
- `links`: `{"fact_ids": ["…", "…"]}` — the facts you cited (only ids that exist
  in the fact graph)
- (`verifiable` defaults to `false` for this kind — it is a synthesis/judgment,
  not an objectively checkable claim; leave it unset.)

Then hand the elaboration to the **strategy consult** (the `consult` skill):
it feeds this elaboration to the strong model as the prompt and records the
reply as a `master_guidance` entry. Elaboration is the *input*; `master_guidance`
is the *reply* — never conflate the two, and do not consult or dispatch from
inside this skill. You dispatch workers from the resulting `master_guidance`
afterward, and keep the operator informed at the right severity.

## Tools

Reference the role=main MCP tools by name (never internal engine paths):

- `gm_search` / read `runtime/projects/<p>/global_memory/<kind>.jsonl` — gather
  findings, dead ends, recent verifications, current `master_guidance`.
- `fact_search` / read `runtime/projects/<p>/fact_graph/facts/*.md` — the verified
  facts and the DAG (`fact_search` to pull the facts bearing on a sub-task; read
  the files for the full statements/proofs and predecessor structure).
- `gm_add` (kind `elaboration`) — publish the synthesis.
- `search_arxiv_theorems` — optional, to sanity-check whether a missing bridge
  already exists in the literature before you name it.
