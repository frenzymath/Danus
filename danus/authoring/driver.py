"""One-shot isolated codex driver for the main-only artifact renderers.

Both ``danus.write_paper`` and ``danus.human_summary`` delegate the heavy
generation (the full ``.tex`` / the report / the auditor report) to a local codex
at extra-high (``xhigh``) reasoning, via the same codex-exec machinery the proving
workers and the verify service use (all at the neutral ``xhigh`` default). The prompt is large (it embeds the style guide / writer prompt plus
the fact-graph content), so it goes on **stdin**, not argv — argv can't reliably
hold it. codex's **stdout is the artifact**: the model emits the document, the
driver captures it.

Isolation by construction: codex runs with ``cwd`` = a fresh empty
``tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()`` so it has nothing local to read. The prompt
(assembled by each renderer's ``assemble.py``) already embeds everything the role
needs — including ``AGENTS.md`` — so codex relies only on the embedded prompt, not
on files it might discover on disk. NB: the ``--sandbox read-only`` flag bounds
*writes*, not necessarily *reads*; the empty cwd + fully-embedded prompt are what
actually give the isolation. If a future codex exposes a finer sandbox-root flag,
prefer it.

Two exec tails share this one driver (see ``run_codex``):

- the **offline default** (writer / auditor / reviser) — ``--sandbox read-only``,
  no MCP, no web; the empty cwd + embedded prompt are the whole world;
- the **networked variant** (the reference verifier) — mirrors
  ``danus.verify.launcher``: ``--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`` with
  the danus gateway injected via ``-c`` at ``DANUS_ROLE=verifier`` (the read-only
  ``search_arxiv_theorems`` role — no new gateway role) plus codex's built-in
  ``web_search``. The empty cwd is kept, so codex still cannot read/write the
  project tree; its only outward reach is the gateway's read-only tool + web.


Config (env, read at CALL time — never import time; resolved via the shared
``danus.codex`` launcher):
  DANUS_CODEX_BIN     codex binary (alias: CODEX_BIN; default: the deployment's
                      bin/codex wrapper, else "codex" on PATH)
  DANUS_CODEX_MODEL   neutral default model (default "gpt-5.5"); each renderer's
                      server layers its own per-service override on top
  DANUS_CODEX_EFFORT  neutral default reasoning effort (default "xhigh")

    Runs with ``cwd`` = a fresh empty temp dir (isolation). Returns the

    honesty (a nonzero returncode / empty stdout / timeout is NOT success). Raises
    ``subprocess.TimeoutExpired`` on timeout and ``FileNotFoundError`` if the codex
    binary is absent — the server translates both into an honest non-``ok`` status.

    Two mutually-exclusive tails, chosen by ``networked``:

    - **Offline (default, ``networked=False``)** — the historical renderer path:
      ``--sandbox read-only --skip-git-repo-check``, no MCP, no web. codex has an
      empty cwd and a fully-embedded prompt, so it reads nothing and reaches
      nothing. This is what the writer / auditor / reviser use.

    - **Networked (``networked=True``)** — the reference-verifier path, mirroring
      ``danus.verify.launcher.build_codex_command``: replace the read-only sandbox
      with ``--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`` (net-capable), inject the
      danus gateway via ``-c`` at ``DANUS_ROLE=<gateway_role>`` (default
      ``verifier`` — exposes ONLY ``search_arxiv_theorems``, minimum privilege; no
      new gateway role is created), and enable codex's built-in ``web_search``
      tool. The empty cwd is kept, so the only writes/reads are through the

      tree; the caller (``server.reference_verify``) is the sole writer of the ledger.
